## CBA

My [CBA for World Themes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kasb7nI-9HZuIBldRL0yFJXUZUobt51bLGtgicT3zGk/edit) applies to standards `RI.9-10.3` and `W.9-10.1`.

It applies to standard `RI.9-10.3` because in the first paragraph it lists the main reasons WWI started and the rest of the paper followed that format. It also applies because Nationalism let to Imperialism and that let to Militarism and then that led to Allies. It applies also because this was a big assignment in World Themes and I would imagine that it would be a topic in English.

The CBA applies to standard `W.9-10.1` because I gave sources in a "professional" way. It also applies because the reasoning on why the evidence applies perfectly matches. The Evidence goes back to the first paragraph with my claim (Thesis statement!).
