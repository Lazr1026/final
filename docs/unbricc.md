## Unbrick Guide

My [Wii U Unbrick Guide](https://lazr1026.github.io/unbrick/#/) covers standards `L.9-10.2` and `L.9-10.3A`.

For standard `L.9-10.2` this is because when I was writting this I made sure I used proper English. If I did not use proper english the guide would not make sense in some places and thats hard to follow. Another thing is I made this for the Wii U Scene, since the guide that used a Teensy was a pain since the Teensy++ 2.0 was not being manufactured anymore.

Now for standard `L.9-10.3A` , This guide fits this standard because it is a guide written to be followed by those that can at least read. It has also been edited to update information, an example of this is when UDPIH released, it outdated my guide for most people. This also ties back to the standard `L.9-10.2` with the guide being updated if I ever missed a period or something.
