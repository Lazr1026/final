## Recombinant DNA Presentation

My [rDNA Presentation from Biology](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QwjkNqPEaLT13qsDGZ-kblZdiWrqGD-A14h6uuPK3hU/edit#slide=id.p) covers standards `SL.9-10.2` and `W.9-10.8`.

It applies to standard `SL.9-10.2` because the info I used was from a source that was trusted on multiple presentations i've done in the past. It also applies to this standard because I used multiple sources in this presentation. Another thing that makes me think that it had good information was the fact Galvas said it was a good presentation. 

The Presentation applies to standard `W.9-10.8` because I had a book from the library (didnt use it though..) and used Google to find trusted sources. Another reason it applies is because the usefulness from the sources was informational on how it worked. One last reason is it contains a general structure throughout the entire presentation.
